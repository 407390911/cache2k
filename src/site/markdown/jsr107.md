# Differences to JSR 107

This document describes notable differences in behaviour of the cache2k API in difference to the
JSR107 definition of the same or similar named functionality.

## Read-through and get()/peek()

TODO: needs final decision:
The semantics of Cache.get() and Cache.peek() never changes whether the cache is operated in read through
mode or not. Cache.get() will always do everything to provide the value and hence yield an exception if no
CacheSource is set. Cache.peek() will return a value if already present in the cache or null.
