# Differences to JSR 107

## Read-through and get()/peek()

The semantics of Cache.get() and Cache.peek() never changes whether the cache is operated in read through
mode. Cache.get() will always do everything to provide the value and hence yield an exception if no
CacheSource is set. Cache.peek() will return a value if already mapped withing the cache.
