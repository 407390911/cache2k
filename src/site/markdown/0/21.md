## Possible breakages


## New and Noteworthy

  * Rewrote internal locking schema. When an entry is fetched from the CacheSource it is not done within
    synchronized block any more. Instead the entry in locked and unlocked again when the entry operation is finished.
    This is less effective, per cache operation that involves storage or persistence or a CacheSource we need one synchronized more.
    The previous approach was bad, since the state of an entry could not be changed when an operation is in progress.

## Fixes and Improvements

  * Exceptions: Add the expiry time the message of the propagated exception. This way an exception gets an almost unique identifier and it becomes
    obvious when cached exceptions become rethrown multiple time or whether it is a new one.
  * Exceptions: Optionally write caught exceptions from source to the debug log (Tunable.logSourceExceptions)
  * Fix possible inconsistency between lastModification and value in CacheEntry

## API Changes and new methods

  * Cache.close() and CacheManager.close(), deprecated: Cache.destroy() and CacheManager.destroy()
  * Cache.getEntry()
