# cache2k version 0.22 release notes

## Possible breakages

  * Semantics of Cache.getAll() changed. Instead of returning always a map size equal to the requested count of keys,
    only keys with a non-null mapping are returned in the map.
  * Added generic types to the methods CacheBuilder.entryExpiryCalculator and CacheBuilder.exceptionExpiryCalculator

## New and Noteworthy

  * Beginning of JSR107 support.
  * classloader support

## Fixes and Improvements

  * Cache.iterator(): Proper exception on wrong usage of iterator pattern
  * Cache.iterator(): Fix semantics for direct call to next() without call to hasNext()
  * Fix usage counter for clock and clock pro implementation together with clear() operation
  * Fix possible race condition in cache manager when adding and closing caches and requesting an iteration of the existing caches
  * Handle exceptions within the expiry calculator more gracefully (still needs work, entry state is inconsistent if an exceptions happens here)
  * ExceptionPropagator for customising the propagation of cached exception
