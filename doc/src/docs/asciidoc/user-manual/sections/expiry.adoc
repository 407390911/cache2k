= Expiry and Refresh

== Variable Expiry

== Advanced Expiry Policy

== Sharp Expiry

== Cached Exceptions and Expiry


== Refresh Ahead



If _sharp expiry and refresh ahead_ is enabled in combination the contract of refresh ahead
is relaxed. This will lead to:

 - Entries will expire exactly at the specified time
 - A refresh started at the expiry time
 - `contains()` is `false`, if the entry is expired and not yet refreshed
 - A `get()` on the expired entry will stall until refreshed

== Resetting the Expiry of a Cache Value
